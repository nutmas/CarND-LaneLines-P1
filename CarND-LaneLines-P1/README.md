Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

This repository contains my pipeline for detecting lines in images and videos:

My python notebook code is: [P1.ipynb code](https://github.com/nutmas/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/P1.ipynb), and the write-up is: [writeup](https://github.com/nutmas/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/writeup_template.md).

The outputs files to show the results:

* [images results with line detection applied](https://github.com/nutmas/CarND-LaneLines-P1/tree/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/test_images_output)
* [video results with line detection applied](https://github.com/nutmas/CarND-LaneLines-P1/tree/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/test_videos_output)
